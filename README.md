## Assignment Questions

1. Illustrate about any two examples of expert task and mundane task in the domain of artificial intelligence. What are the key differences between these two task domains? Explain any TWO latest technological introductions into the domain of AI?

2. Generate a tiny real world problem that can be solved by min-max strategy. Solve it using the same. Present an improved algorithm over min-max strategy (game playing) with explanatory steps and apply on the same/similar real-world problem.

3. Translate the following into FOPL:
    i) No one sleeps
   ii) Everyone hates everyone except herself
   iii) Everyone except Joe eats
   iv) Every person who loves God is happy
   v) Someone hates everyone

4. Convert the following into clausal form (write down steps):
      ∃x∃ y ∀w (∃z P(f(x, w), y, z) -> (∃u Q(x, u) & ∃vR(y, v)).

5. Which of the following are true and which are false? Give brief explanations.
   
a) In a fully observable, turn-taking, zero-sum game between two perfectly rational players, it does not help the first player to know what strategy the second player is using - that is, what move the second player will make, given the first player’s move.

b) In a partially observable, turn-taking, zero-sum game between two perfectly rational players, it does not help the first player to know what move the second player will make, given the first player’s move.

c) A perfectly rational backgammon agent never loses.

6. Consider any one of the following domains and identify a sub-domain. Construct a Bayesian Belief Network with a minimum of 7 nodes (random variables of Boolean type). Identify the dependent variables, independent variables and conditionally independent variables. Explain your answer with a worked-out example and its corresponding network diagram.
